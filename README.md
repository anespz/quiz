This project was created with create-react-app, and has therefore got some boilerplate code in different files. 
More instructions on how to run the react app is given in the README generated by react-create-app. 
The main files I have worked on are

- src

    |- Cards

        |- MenuCard.js

        |- QuestionCard.js

        |- ResultsCard.js

    |- Container.js
    
    |- Style.js

## Bugs

There is currently one known bug in the code: 
When going from menu to one of the activities, error messages will appear because of an async fetch returning too late. 
To continue the demo around this bug, refresh the browser page. 

## Features not implemented

The timed "Round" cards between rounds has not been implemented due to lack of time. 
They could have been linked to the rest of the question cards in QuestionCard's redirect(path) method, and timed using setTimeout().
The interface is also currently very simple, and could have been made to look more similar to the refence given more time. 

## The MockAPI

I ended up using a local copy of the .json file (./mockAPI.json) for testing, 
which I ran on a local server (http://localhost:3000/payload') using 'json-server --watch mockAPI.json'. 

The data added from the quiz stays as a history of user answers, for the mock scenario that you would want to analyse it. 
There is currently no interface method for clearing the user data, as I did this manually when testing.
